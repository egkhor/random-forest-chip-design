# Contributing to Random Forest Chip Design

We welcome contributions to enhance this ML project for chip design defect prediction! Here‚Äôs how to help:

- **Datasets**: Share anonymized or synthetic chip design data (CSVs).
- **Models**: Optimize Random Forest hyperparameters or test algorithms (e.g., SVM, Gradient Boosting).
- **Visualizations**: Add feature importance plots (via matplotlib).

## How to Contribute
1. Fork: `https://github.com/egkhor/random-forest-chip-design`.
2. Branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`.
3. Commit: `git commit -m "Add your feature"`.
4. Push and open a pull request.

## Guidelines
- Document code clearly.
- Test scripts locally.
- Use synthetic data to avoid proprietary issues.

Thanks for advancing ML in chip design! üñ•Ô∏è
